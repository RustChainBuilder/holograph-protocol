 * @title Contract Test - Holograph
 * @notice This contract contains a series of tests to verify the functionality of the Holograph contract.
 * The tests cover the initialization process, getter functions, and setter functions.
 * @dev The tests include verifying initialization, admin functions, revert behaviors, and external contract interactions.
 * The tests check the validity of various contract slots like bridge, chainId, factory, interfaces, operator, registry,
 * treasury, and utilityToken.
 * The tests also verify that only the admin can alter certain contract slots, while non-owners trigger revert behaviors.
